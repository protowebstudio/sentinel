          The risk signal is designed to be explainable: a bounded score (0–100) derived from deterministic severity weights over a fixed window.
          The goal is not prediction; it is repeatable measurement.
        </p>
        <p>
          Sentinel does not compute risk. It presents narrative and proofs. The execution core performs ingestion validation and risk computation.
